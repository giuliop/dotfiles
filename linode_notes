Only a few port are open by setting up a firewall as described in http://library.linode.com/securing-your-server
Check them with command:

$ sudo iptables -vL
$ sudo iptables -t nat -vnL

>>> Section below not true anymore, port 80 is not forwarded now <<<
Port 80 is forwarded to port 8080 to use webservers without sudo (as per http://serverfault.com/questions/112795/how-can-i-run-a-server-on-linux-on-port-80-as-a-normal-user)

Forwarded done by command:

$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d giuliopizzini.com -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

To delete forwarding:

$ sudo iptables -t nat --line-numbers -n -L
$ sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING <line number>  (where line number comes from above)
$ sudo iptables -t nat -D OUTPUT <line number>      (where line number comes from above)
>>> end of section <<<

iptables rules are saved and reloaded on reboot with iptables-persistent package
to change them:
$ iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

    sslh --listen 178.79.141.51:443 --ssh 127.0.0.1:22 --ssl 127.0.0.1:8443
